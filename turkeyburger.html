        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            We love our turkey burger for one simple reason: We let it be. We didn't try to cover up the fact that it was turkey. Instead, we embraced it. We brought out its flavors and made it the best dang turkey burger there is. Turkey burgers tend to be drier so we added an egg to ours to help it hold together and give it added moisture. We also use 94 percent lean ground turkey and don't recommend any higher than that or the burgers might not hold together.
